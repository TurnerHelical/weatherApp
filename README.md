# Weather App
This project is built using mostly vanilla JS using webpack to bundle. Using the Visual Crossings API you can input a location to view the next week of forecasted weather. You can also check historical weather data by selecting either a specific date or range of dates(max 7). 

Run npm install and npx webpack serve to test it on your local computer
